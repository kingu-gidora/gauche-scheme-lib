[function] mpd:process-exists?
Check if a 'mpd' process is running.
This function do a process call to 'ps' and check is mpd is present. It is not efficient!

[function] mpd:connect 
Connect to mpd.  This is a low-level function that is not supposed to be used on high-level code. (the connection is managed automatically when you issue a mpd command)

[function] mpd->http CMD
This is just an experimental wrapper.  it issue the command CMD, return a http header and the result as JSON data.  It might not work with some commands.

[function] mpd:command CMD
Send CMD to mpd.  CMD is a string.  It incluse both the command and it's arguments.
For example to set the volume to 50%, you would do: (mpd:command "setvol 50").
However, you dont usually use mpd:command directly.
The real good way for the above command would be: (mpd:setvol 50)

[function] mpd:clearerror
Clears the current error message in status (this is also accomplished by any command that starts playback).

[function] mpd:currentsong
Displays the song info of the current song (same song that is identified in status).
